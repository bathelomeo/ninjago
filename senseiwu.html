        Wu grew up learning the art of the ninja alongside his older brother. 
        Garmadon, who was infected with evil. 
        They fought together as a team against evil for many years.
        Until Garmadon's corruption completed and he was later sent to the Underworld.
        Around a decade later Wu trained a group of teenagers in the ways of Spinjitzu.
        One wu was hit with the Forward Time Blade.
        That caused him to fastly age. 
        Though his health was restored by the Reversal Time Blade. 
        He sacrificed himself in a bid to defeat the Time Twins 
        And then he got lost in time. 
        The loss of Wu left Lloyd in charge of the ninja.

        Wu guided the ninja in many fights against his brother 
        And the Serpentine. 
        Wu also guided the ninja in fighting and the Overlord.
        When the Nindroid crisis began Wu was corrupted into a cyborg.
        And they made it their goal to find Wu.
        Wu returned as a baby.
        Because he was hit with the Reversal Time Blade.
        When wu was a baby the ninja found him in a jungle.
        The efects of both blades impacted him.

        Until he was rescued by Cole.

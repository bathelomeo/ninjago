    Nya is the Elemental Master of water.
    She is the water Ninja.
    She is Kai's sister.
    Her father is Ray.
    Her mother is Maya. 
    After meeting Wu Nya and Kai joined him in his quest to protect Ninjago. 
    Her brother trained to be a ninja before her. 
    Nya got tired of being left out from the team. 
    And created the identity of Samurai X. 
    Jay began to start a relationship with Nya.
    We are gathered here today to honor the memory of Nya.
    She was an Inventor.
    The Samurai X.
    A great ninja.
    Master of Water.
    And our dearest friend.
    Her courage and strength have saved us time and time again.
    And although we- we were unable to save her.
    We will always remember her.
    Wherever she is now, she is in our hearts.

    After Nya destroyed the Cursed Realm, the ninja fought Nadakhan, who rebuilt his home realm in Ninjago, though this was undone by Jay's final wish. On the Day of the Departed, Cole accidentally revived Cryptor (and many other deceased villains), who Zane fought and destroyed once more. When the Time Twins and Vermillion warriors fought the ninja, Zane helped the ninja defeat their adversaries, but lost contact with P.I.X.A.L. in the chaos.

    So they could protect the land his father created. 
    Wu guided the ninja in many battles against his brother, the Serpentine, and the Overlord.
    When the Nindroid crisis began, Wu was corrupted into a cyborg but was purified after the Digital Overlord was vanquished. After the ninja went to a mysterious island to save Zane, Wu joined the Elemental Masters to fight Chen and his Anacondrai warriors.
    After Garmadon was banished to the Cursed Realm and the close of the Second Serpentine War, Wu's first pupil, Morro, escaped the Cursed Realm.<strong>Wiki Fandom</strong>
